## Curator

Our adjustments and upgrades for Zeus.

### Automatic Zeus assignment

Some missions involve more than one Zeus. It is hard to get it working correctly and without problems when one Zeus disconnects. Not anymore. All units with variable `afm_curator_isZeus` set to true on init will have curator module assigned on startup (and JIP).
